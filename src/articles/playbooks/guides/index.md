# Playbook Guides

Playbooks are a powerful tool for automating your Customer Success processes. So much flexibility and power comes with the "blank canvas" problem. Where do you even start?

Well, in this set of guides, we provide a set of practical Playbooks you can start using right away!

* [Alert your team about an unhappy customer in Slack](xref:playbooks.guides.alert-unhappy) - This is a guide to build a Playbook to detect negative sentiment among your customers leveraging Abbot's built-in AI Enhancements.
* [Ask for Approval Before Sending A Discount Code](xref:playbooks.guides.approval-workflow) - This guide shows how to build a Playbook that asks your first responders for approval before taking an automated action. In this case, the action is to send a discount code to an unhappy customer, but it could easily be something else.
* [Share a Usage Report with your Customers](xref:playbooks.guides.sharing-usage-report) - This is an advanced guide that shows you how to set up a scheduled Playbook to share usage stats with your customers every week. This guide leverages Abbot's Skills functionality to pull data from an external source so that it can share information with your customers on a schedule. Sharing usage stats with customers is a fantastic way to create proactive engagement, drive adoption, and show how your product creates values for your customers.
* [Alert your team about an inactive customer in Slack](xref:playbooks.guides.customer-inactivity-alert) - When a team manages many customers, it can be easy to miss when one has gone quiet. A lack of customer communication may indicate a churn risk. Abbot can monitor your customer channels and alert your team if a customer has gone quiet using this Playbook.
