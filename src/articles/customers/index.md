# Customer Management in Abbot

Abbot helps you track the Customers you work with in Slack.
Manage customers from the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers).

A Customer in Abbot can be associated with one or more Slack Channels.
You can also group customers in to [Segments](xref:customers.segments) to make it easier to target [Playbooks](xref:playbooks) and [Announcements](xref:announcements) to specific groups of customers.

## Create a Customer Record

1. To create a customer record, start on the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers).
    Click "Create customer" to create a customer.
    Later on, you can [customers for all your existing rooms](xref:customers.bulk-create), but for now let's start with a single one so you can see how it works.

2. Enter the name of the customer, and select the channel you want to associate with this customer. If you don't see the channel you want, you may need to [invite Abbot to the channel](xref:quick-start.tracking-conversations#configuring-a-customer-channel).
