# Customer Segments

Abbot allows you to group customers into segments.
You can target [Playbooks](xref:playbooks) and [Announcements](xref:announcements) to specific segments of customers.
We recommend creating segments that are meaningful to your business.
A Customer can be a part of multiple segments, so there's no limit to how you organize your customers.

## Managing Segments

1. On the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers), click "Manage segments" to manage your customer segments.

2. Click "Create segment" to create a new segment. Enter a name for the segment. Segment names must cannot contain spaces, so we recommend using single word or compound word names like "Enterprise", "PremiumPlan", "ExtendedSupport", etc.

3. Return to the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers). Each customer has a "Manage" link that allows you to manage the segments that customer is a part of. You could even skip steps 1 and 2 and create the segment right here!

## Using Segments

Segments can be used in many different ways:

1. [Playbooks](xref:playbooks) can be configured to run for specific segments of customers.
2. [Announcements](xref:announcements) can be sent to specific segments of customers.
