# The Conversation Timeline

Abbot maintains a Timeline for each Conversation, capturing all the events that happened during the life of that conversation.

## Accessing the Timeline

### Using the Message Shortcut

The easiest way to access the Conversation timeline is via the "Manage Conversation" message shortcut.
To access this, press the "triple-dot" menu for a message and select the "Manage Conversation" shortcut

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to select "More message shortcutsâ€¦" to find the shortcut.

If the message is not part of a conversation, you'll get an error message:

If the message is part of a conversation, you'll get some options.
The specific options you see depends on the features enabled for your account, and what [Integrations](xref:integrations) you have configured.
The first option, "View this conversation on ab.bot", is always present and will take you straight to the Conversation Timeline

### From the Web UI

You can also open a conversation timeline by finding the conversation in the [Conversation List](https://app.ab.bot/conversations) and clicking on the title.

## What's on the Timeline?

The timeline captures several different types of events:

* Messages posted in the thread
* Transitions between states
* Linked tickets created by integrations, such as the [Zendesk Integration](xref:integrations.zendesk)
