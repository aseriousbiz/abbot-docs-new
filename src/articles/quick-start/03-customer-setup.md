# Set up customer records

Abbot helps you track the Customers you work with in Slack.
In the [previous section](xref:quick-start.tracking-conversations), we showed you how to configure a Hub and Customer Channel.

## Create a Customer Record

1. To create a customer record, start on the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers).
    Click "Create customer" to create a customer.
    Later on, you can [create customers for all your existing rooms](xref:customers.bulk-create), but for now let's start with a single one so you can see how it works.

2. Enter the name of the customer, and select the channel you want to associate with this customer. If you don't see the channel you want, you may need to [invite Abbot to the channel](xref:quick-start.tracking-conversations#configuring-a-customer-channel).

3. Click "Create customer" to create the customer record.

## Customer Segments

Abbot allows you to group customers into segments.
You can target [Playbooks](xref:playbooks) and [Announcements](xref:announcements) to specific segments of customers.
We recommend creating segments that are meaningful to your business.
A Customer can be a part of multiple segments, so there's no limit to how you organize your customers.

1. On the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers), click "Manage segments" to manage your customer segments.

2. Click "Create segment" to create a new segment. Enter a name for the segment. Segment names must cannot contain spaces, so we recommend using single word or compound word names like "Enterprise", "PremiumPlan", "ExtendedSupport", etc.

3. Return to the [Customers tab in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/customers). Each customer has a "Manage" link that allows you to manage the segments that customer is a part of. You could even skip steps 1 and 2 and create the segment right here!

## Next Steps

Now that you've created a customer, let's see how to [create a Playbook](xref:quick-start.playbooks) that notifies our team when a customer appears to be unhappy with us.
