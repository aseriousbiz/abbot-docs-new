# Create your first Playbook

Now that you've [created a customer record](xref:quick-start.customer-setup), let's create a Playbook to notify our team when any of our customers appear to be unhappy.

## Create a Playbook

Playbooks are a way to automate common Customer Operations workflows.
See the [Playbooks](xref:playbooks) page for more information.
For now, we'll create a simple Playbook that notifies our team when a customer appears to be unhappy.

1. Start on the [Playbooks page in Abbot](https://app.ab.bot/Playbooks). Click "Create" to create a new Playbook.
