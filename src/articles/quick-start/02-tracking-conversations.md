# Start tracking conversations

Now that [Abbot is installed in your workspace](xref:quick-start.install), you can put them to work!
Configure a Hub and Customer Channels to start tracking conversations.

## Configuring a Hub

When Abbot was installed into your workspace, Abbot created a Hub channel.
You were prompted for the channel name for this Hub when you installed Abbot:

If, for some reason, this didn't happen, you can [create a Hub channel manually](xref:conversation-management.hubs#setting-up-a-hub).

## Configuring a Customer Channel

Now that you have a Hub, you can create a Customer Channel to track conversations with a customer.
In any shared Slack Connect channel, invite Abbot to the channel using `/invite @abbot` (or whatever you named your Abbot bot user):

Abbot will immediately enable Conversation Tracking in this room.
You can configure this (including disabling tracking altogether) by clicking the "Edit Conversation Tracking" button:

## Next Steps

Once you've started tracking conversations in the channel, you should [set up customer records](xref:quick-start.customer-setup).
