# Integrations

Abbot integrates with services you already use to make it easier to manage customer relationships.
Abbot can create tickets in your ticketing system, manage conversations in chat channels, and more.

Configure your active integrations from the [Integration Settings](https://app.ab.bot/settings/organization/integrations) page.
On this page you can see all the integrations available to your organization, enable and disable them, and configure them as needed:
